The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that regulates the transfer of solutes and chemicals between the circulatory system and the central nervous system.  It protects the brain from harmful substances in the blood.  The BBB is formed by endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and pericytes.  It allows passage of small molecules by passive diffusion and actively transports nutrients like glucose and amino acids.  The BBB restricts pathogens, large or hydrophilic molecules, and peripheral immune factors.  However, circumventricular organs and the choroid plexus have highly permeable capillaries.  The BBB's tight junctions, composed of occludin, claudins (like Claudin-5), and junctional adhesion molecules, contribute to its selectivity.  A functional BBB is present at birth.  BBB dysfunction is implicated in various neurological and systemic diseases, hindering drug delivery.  Therapeutic research focuses on methods to cross the BBB, including intranasal administration and nanoparticles.  The concept of a blood-brain barrier was first hypothesized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) tightly regulates the movement of ions, molecules, and cells between the blood and the brain, maintaining CNS homeostasis and protecting neural tissue.  This review discusses the cells of the BBB (endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, immune cells), the molecules involved (tight junctions, transporters, transcytosis factors, leukocyte adhesion molecules), and the signaling pathways regulating BBB formation and homeostasis (Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog).  BBB dysfunction is a key feature of many neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease, often involving alterations in tight junctions, transporters, and transcytosis.  Further research is needed to fully understand the complexities of BBB regulation and dysfunction in disease.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a protective layer lining blood vessels in the brain.  It acts as a filter, keeping harmful substances out and beneficial substances in, controlling the movement of molecules into and out of the brain.

**Function:**  The BBB's endothelial cells are tightly packed, preventing most things from passing through without assistance.  Lipid-soluble substances can pass easily, while larger or water-soluble molecules require transport mechanisms.  Substances that can pass include alcohol, anesthetics, many medications, and caffeine.  Pathogens and toxins generally cannot.

**Conditions and Disorders:**  Inflammation or other conditions can weaken the BBB, allowing harmful substances to enter the brain.  Acute conditions affecting the BBB include brain cancers, infections (encephalitis and meningitis), concussion/TBI, hypercapnia, hypoxia, stroke, and seizures. Chronic conditions include Alzheimer's disease, ALS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epilepsy, frontotemporal dementia, hypertension, hyperglycemia/Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and Parkinson's disease.  There's currently no clear way to directly identify BBB problems, though research is ongoing.

**Treatments:**  There are no treatments that directly target the BBB. Instead, treatments focus on managing conditions that weaken it.  These include medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar; treatments to restore blood circulation after stroke; anti-seizure medications; and cancer treatments.

**Care:** To maintain BBB health, focus on maintaining a healthy weight and balanced diet, promptly treating infections, wearing safety equipment to prevent head injuries, and managing chronic health conditions.

**Healthcare Provider Considerations:** The BBB is a key factor in treating brain and body conditions.  Some medications cannot pass through, requiring alternative approaches like using "Trojan horse" methods or leveraging the body's natural chemistry.

**Discovery and Detection:**  While others contributed to early understanding, Lina Shtern and Raymond Gautier first used the term "blood-brain barrier" in 1921.  Electron microscopy in the 1960s and 70s confirmed its structure.

**Note:** The BBB is a vital defense mechanism, but its imperfections highlight the need for continued research to improve treatments for brain-related conditions.

The brain is precious, and evolution has gone to great lengths to protect it from damage.  Our 7mm thick skull is the most obvious defense, but the brain is also surrounded by protective cerebrospinal fluid and the meninges.  The blood–brain barrier provides further defense against disease-causing pathogens and toxins in the blood.

The blood–brain barrier was discovered in the late 19th century.  Its key structure is the endothelial tight junction, where endothelial cells form tight gaps, allowing only small, fat-soluble molecules, and some gases to pass into brain tissue. Larger molecules, like glucose, use transporter proteins.  Other components surrounding the endothelial cells also influence the barrier's selectivity.

The blood–brain barrier protects against toxins and pathogens while allowing nutrients to reach the brain. It also maintains constant levels of hormones, nutrients, and water.  Damage, such as from bacterial infection (e.g., meningococcal disease) or multiple sclerosis, compromises its function, leading to inflammation or neuronal signaling problems.

The blood–brain barrier impedes drug delivery for mental and neurological disorders.  Approaches to overcome this include the "Trojan horse" method (fusing drugs to molecules that can cross the barrier) and temporarily opening the barrier using ultrasound.  Ultrasound, combined with gas microbubbles, shows promise in improving drug delivery to the brain and treating Alzheimer's disease, without causing brain damage.

Structure and function of the blood-brain barrier are summarized.  The physical barrier formed by endothelial tight junctions and the transport barrier from membrane transporters and vesicular mechanisms are described.  The roles of astrocytic glial cells, pericytes, and microglia are outlined.  Embryonic development and changes in pathology are discussed.  The BBB's short and long-term regulation, which may be disturbed in pathology, is noted.  Drug discovery and delivery programs targeting or avoiding the CNS need to consider the BBB's special features.
