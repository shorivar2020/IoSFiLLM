A meta-analysis compared adverse experiences (AEs) during multiple-dose nonprescription ibuprofen use to placebo.  Eight studies (800-1200 mg/day ibuprofen for 1-10 days) were included. AEs were classified using COSTART (abdominal pain reassigned to the digestive system).  Overall AE frequency was numerically less in ibuprofen-treated subjects (n=1094) than placebo (n=1093).  Pooled data showed placebo subjects reported AEs significantly more often (31.7% vs 27.4%, p=0.018). Digestive system AE frequency was comparable (p=0.420, 11.0% placebo vs 12.1% ibuprofen).  "Body-as-a-whole" AEs were significantly higher in placebo (20.4% vs 14.8%, p<0.001). Severe AEs were lower with ibuprofen.  Nonprescription ibuprofen shows an excellent side effect profile in multiple-dose use, with gastrointestinal AEs comparable to placebo.  PMID: 10234601

Variability in the Analgesic Response to Ibuprofen Is Associated With Cyclooxygenase Activation in Inflammatory Pain

**Abstract**

The mechanisms underlying interindividual variability in analgesic efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not well understood.  This study performed pain phenotyping, functional neuroimaging, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessments, inflammation biomarkers, and gene expression profiling in healthy subjects who underwent surgical extraction of bony impacted third molars and were treated with ibuprofen (400 mg; N=19) or placebo (N=10). Analgesic efficacy was not associated with demographic or clinical characteristics, ibuprofen pharmacokinetics, or the degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition by ibuprofen. Compared with partial responders to ibuprofen (N=9, required rescue medication within the dosing interval), complete responders (N=10, no rescue medication) exhibited greater induction of urinary prostaglandin metabolites and serum tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 8. Differentially expressed genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were enriched for inflammation-related pathways. These findings suggest that a less pronounced activation of the inflammatory prostanoid system is associated with insufficient pain relief on ibuprofen alone and the need for additional therapeutic intervention.


**Introduction**

Although acute pain can serve an adaptive function, inadequate pain management can delay healing. Opioids are important for postoperative pain management, but overprescription contributes to the opioid epidemic.  NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostanoid synthesis.  In inflammatory pain, prostanoids promote sensitization. NSAIDs are effective when COX pathway activation is a key mechanism, such as in third molar extraction. While NSAIDs are effective on average, 20–30% of patients require opioid rescue medication.  Precision medicine approaches could optimize NSAID therapy and reduce opioid prescriptions. This study used deep phenotyping to characterize factors associated with ibuprofen's variable efficacy after third molar extraction.


**Results**

Ibuprofen was significantly more effective than placebo.  Complete responders (no rescue medication) showed greater induction of urinary prostaglandin metabolites and serum TNF-α and IL-8 compared to partial responders (required rescue medication). Differentially expressed genes in PBMCs were enriched for inflammation-related pathways.


**Discussion**

Pain is complex, with interindividual variability in analgesic effectiveness.  This study used multiple techniques to differentiate between partial and complete responders.  Response to ibuprofen could not be predicted by clinical characteristics, pharmacokinetics, or pharmacodynamics. Complete responders had higher urinary PG metabolites, suggesting greater COX pathway activation. Third molar extraction caused a systemic inflammatory response. Complete responders showed greater increases in serum TNF-α and IL-8.  Complete responders exhibited fewer differentially expressed genes and lower inflammatory gene expression. This suggests differences in COX pathway regulation and inflammatory response contribute to ibuprofen's variable efficacy.  Limitations include small sample size and focus on healthy young adults.


**Conclusion**

Marked interindividual variability in ibuprofen's analgesic efficacy after third molar extraction is not explained by clinical characteristics, ibuprofen plasma concentrations, or COX inhibition. Differences in urinary PG metabolites, serum cytokines, and gene expression suggest that inflammatory response regulation differs between responders. Identifying biomarkers predictive of NSAID response could limit unnecessary opioid prescriptions.


**Methods**

Healthy subjects (≥18 years) undergoing third molar extraction were enrolled.  Subjects abstained from analgesics for one week prior to surgery.  Baseline blood and urine samples were collected. Pain intensity was reported every 15 minutes (0-10 scale). Ibuprofen (400 mg) or placebo was administered after a pain score ≥4. fMRI scanning continued for up to 60 minutes. Rescue medication (hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) was allowed. Post-surgery blood and urine samples were collected at ~1.5 and ~3 hours post-drug administration.  COX activity (in vivo and ex vivo), plasma drug concentrations, serum cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, MCP-1), and gene expression in PBMCs were analyzed.  Statistical analyses included t-tests, ANOVA, nonparametric equivalents, log-rank test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test.  Data are accessible through Gene Expression Omnibus Series accession number GSE120596.

Systematic review: intravenous Ibuprofen in preterm newborns

**Abstract:** Ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, widely used as antipyretic, antiinflammatory, and analgesic agent and for therapy of arthritis, exerts a dose-dependent constriction of the ductus arteriosus in newborn lambs. Two intravenous preparations, namely ibuprofen lysine and ibuprofen-THAM, have been studied in preterm newborns with patent ductus arteriosus. Clinical trials have compared IV ibuprofen to placebo, or to indomethacin. Pharmacodynamic effects of this drug before and after its administration have also been evaluated. Compared with placebo, IV ibuprofen effectively closed PDA with minimal effect on renal function. One study using intravenous ibuprofen-THAM showed decreased renal function and increased risk of NEC and PPHN. Compared with indomethacin, IV ibuprofen lysine exerted similar efficacy (75% to 93% closure). However, indomethacin increased abnormal renal function and decreased mesenteric and cerebral blood flow and bio-energetics. Two clinical trials showed that ibuprofen did not reduce the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage compared with placebo. The drug has prolonged elimination (plasma half-life = ca 23 hours), suggesting that once daily dosing is appropriate. Dose finding studies indicate that a starting dose of 10 mg/kg followed by 5 mg/kg/d for 2 more days provides optimal efficacy with the least adverse effects. Neonatal data on ibuprofen and indomethacin indicate that, on the first day of life when IVH prevention is desired, indomethacin and not ibuprofen should be used since ibuprofen has no effect on IVH risk. On or after the second day of postnatal life, when early or therapeutic PDA closure is needed, ibuprofen and not indomethacin is probably the first choice due to its better adverse event profile.
