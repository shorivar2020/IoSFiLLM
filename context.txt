2. **High Maintenance:** A realistic portrayal of NYC, following a marijuana dealer who interacts with various clients, showcasing diverse friendships.

3. **Friends:** A classic sitcom about six friends in Manhattan, known for its long run and relatable friendships.

4. **How I Met Your Mother:** Follows five friends in Manhattan, tackling serious themes alongside humor and memorable catchphrases.

5. **Friends From College:** A canceled show (like *Happy Endings*) about six college friends reuniting in NYC, exploring complex relationships.

6. **Insecure:** Centers on two Black women navigating careers and relationships in LA, showcasing strong friendships and character development.

8. **Shrill:** Follows two roommates and best friends, focusing on one woman's journey as a writer and navigating life's challenges.

r/happyendings

We're like the Gilmore Girls, but we came first so we're better.

Are there any other shows that are similar to this series?  I mostly mean in the pacing, joke writing, punchlines, joke style & delivery. I don't mean that I'm looking for the same actors or the same premise of friends that hang out in a bar.

To give some context, I really like shows like Key & Peele, Curb Your Enthusiasm & How I Met Your Mother, but I dislike shows like Scrubs, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and 2 Broke Girls.

Content from [https://between-the-shelves.com/2017/01/the-debate-of-happy-endings/]: 
Everyone loves a happy ending, right?  It gives a warm feeling when lovable characters end up happy, and we strive for happy endings in our own lives.  According to one article, 41% of people prefer happy endings in books. Stories with happy endings offer hope and allow us to escape into another reality.

However, many praised works of literature don't end happily.  *The Great Gatsby* ends with death, *Wuthering Heights* with misery, and *1984* with torture and defeat.  Despite our desire for happy endings, many acclaimed books don't provide them.

This contrast is interesting.  Society desires happy endings, yet many classic books don't have them, while their movie adaptations often do, a phenomenon called the "Hollywood Happy Ending."  Indie movies, conversely, are more likely to have less cheerful conclusions.

Personally, I enjoy books with tragic or open endings.  They spark discussion and encourage rereading.  Books like *Eleanor & Park* and *Every Day* are examples of this.

When reading, do you prefer happy endings?

Here's a cleaned version of the text, removing redundant information and focusing on the core content of the article:

**How the Story Ends: Gender, Sexuality, and Nation in the Happy Ending**

**Heather Schell and Katherine Larsen**

**Abstract**

The happy ending is often viewed as simplistic and untrustworthy.  This essay explores the trope through a polyphonic conversation with experts, examining its relationship to genre, gender, sexuality, and nationality.

**Full Text**

The happy ending is a narrative convention strongly associated with American culture, particularly film and fiction.  Literary modernism considered it a sign of lowbrow work.  Ideological criticism of the 1970s viewed happy endings, especially in romantic comedies, as pernicious, indoctrinating viewers to accept patriarchal harm.  Similar critiques targeted popular romance novels (e.g., Modleski's *Loving with a Vengeance*, Radway's *Reading the Romance*).  Later scholarship, however, complicates these arguments by considering historical context, audience response, and authorial intent.

The Romance Writers of America (RWA) defines romance as a love story with an emotionally satisfying, optimistic ending, making the happy ending a generic requirement (Crusie, 2000; Regis, 2003; Roach, 2016).  However, fan studies show endings are rarely final, with fans often rewriting stories to provide their preferred outcomes.  Archive of Our Own (AO3) lists fifteen ending types, eight potentially "happy." Romance readers, however, tend not to rewrite happy endings.

This essay aims to spark a wider conversation on the happy ending.  The following presents perspectives from various scholars and experts, responding to prompts about its meaning in relation to genre, gender, sexual orientation, and nationality. (The questions themselves are at the end of the essay).

**Expert Perspectives:**

Several experts offered diverse perspectives on the concept of a happy ending:

* **Sarah Lyons:** A romance novel's happy ending involves a functional, lasting relationship; other genres have different conventions.  The definition can encompass various gender and sexual orientations.
* **Kathrina Haji Mohd Daud:** A happy ending fulfills socially and religiously acceptable desires.
* **Caroline Smith:**  The "boy meets girl, loses girl, wins girl back" formula dominates romantic comedies, predominantly featuring white, heterosexual, economically successful couples.
* **Cait Coker:**  A romantic happy ending relates to *agape*, a love striving for betterment and personal fulfillment, often more evident in fan fiction than conventional romances.
* **Jodi McAlister:** A happy ending involves a lasting, egalitarian romantic relationship, resembling Giddens' "pure relationship."
* **Margaret Stetz:** A happy ending lets characters achieve deserved fates and inspires positive social action.
* **Rebecca Williams:** A successful ending aligns with the story's themes and values, otherwise fans feel cheated.
* **Sonali Dev:** Happiness can stem from engaging with a work, not just its conclusion.
* **Radclyffe:** A happy ending is unambiguous, showing committed love and a resolved conflict, although the "happy for now" ending is gaining popularity.
* **Sara Kolmes:**  Happy endings can be unresolved, leaving room for hope, acknowledging that strong bonds can sometimes hinder positive change.
* **Pavla Zapletal:** Happy endings are artificial stopping points, leaving her wanting more; a true happy ending shows enduring belief even through life's changes.
* **Sonali Dev:**  A romantic happy ending is a narrative stopping point, with real life containing a string of happy (and dark) moments.
* **Eric Selinger:** A happy ending brings a sense of being "set in one's place," a triumph of positive attributes over negativity, as defined by Madsen.
* **Elizabeth Morrison:** Happy endings are for fiction, not real life, which constantly changes.
* **Maggie Parke:** The Disney-influenced happy ending focuses on marriage/kiss, often with the man rescuing the woman, even in recent stories featuring "strong female characters."
* **Bethan Jones:** The happy ending often perpetuates heteronormative narratives, especially for young girls.
* **Margaret Gonglewski:** Even in *Cinderella*, the happy ending isn't so happy for the stepsisters, showing the nuances of reward and punishment.
* **Jodi McAlister:** The romantic happy ending's association with the domestic sphere often involves a radical change in the man's worldview.
* **Sara K.:**  In female-focused stories, the happy ending often sees the woman in a traditional role but supported by a man who is unrealistically devoted, as seen in *Twilight*.
* **Michael Gratzke:** Happy endings are stereotypically driven by external circumstances and male agency.
* **Caroline Smith:** Romantic comedies often feature active male and passive female characters, perpetuating harmful ideologies.
* **Lisa Macklem:** There's a prejudice that a woman's happy ending requires a successful relationship, while men can be happy without romantic success; women are often portrayed passively in Hollywood.
* **Rebecca Williams:** A "happy" ending isn't necessarily a "good" ending, depending on genre.
* **Cait Coker:** Mainstream romance fiction reflects societal expectations, often explored in authors like Jennifer Weiner.  M/M romance fiction shows similar patterns but often avoids the heteronormative marriage plot.
* **María Ramos-García:** Happy endings aren't inherently tied to gender, but the *way* they are achieved can attract criticism.
* **Sarah Lyons:**  Happy endings aren't particularly gendered; queer romances need happy endings too.
* **Margaret Stetz:** Happy endings are tied to power, restoring it to those who use it for good and removing it from those who misuse it.
* **Radclyffe:** LGBTQ romances' happy endings have evolved with societal changes; commitment is key, not marriage.
* **Eric Selinger:**  If a happy ending is simply victory, it's not inherently gendered. However, the emphasis on courtship and relationships is often feminized in our culture.
* **Maggie Parke:** The US version of *Pride and Prejudice* ends with a kiss, unlike the UK version, suggesting cultural differences in expectations of happy endings.
* **María Ramos-García:** The expectation of happy endings is very strong in American culture, linked to American exceptionalism and the American Dream, unlike in many European films.
* **Jodi McAlister:**  While the US is prominent, the appeal of happy endings is international, particularly in Anglophone cultures; Australia emphasizes belonging.
* **Kathrina Haji Mohd Daud:** The idea of romantic love as a panacea is particularly American; American pop culture often explores the tragedy of this discourse.
* **Elizabeth Morrison:**  Mainstream US culture prioritizes optimism and individualism;  Chinese culture is more traditionally suspicious of individual happiness.
* **Michael Gratzke:** US culture doesn't have exclusive claim to happy endings, although it has common narratives like "self-made man" and "redemption."
* **Pavla Zapletal:**  Most US movies have happy endings, which are often seen as fake and predictable in the Czech Republic.
* **Lisa Macklem:** Sad endings perform worse at the box office in Hollywood. Canada tends towards unresolved or negative endings.
* **Cait Coker:** Romance often provides narrative closure even when the broader plot remains unresolved.  Marvel's *Civil War* needed a fan-created romance to provide closure.
* **Sara K.:** The fan tendency to create romance in non-romantic relationships can denigrate the importance of platonic friendships.
* **Bethan Jones:** This fan creation often involves non-heteronormative romance, creating a subversive act.
* **Maggie Parke:**  The human experience is grounded in relationships, explaining the popularity of romance and the fan-driven creation of romantic storylines.
* **Lisa Macklem:** Fans create intimate stories missing from broader narratives.
* **Caroline Smith:** Rom-coms, while considered "low art," offer rich material for discussions on social issues.
* **María Ramos-García:** Intellectuals often have a prejudice against happy endings, but that's a gross generalization; complexity isn't negated by a happy conclusion.
* **Eric Selinger:**  The idea of comedy being inferior to tragedy has roots in Aristotle, yet the desire for happy endings can lead to kitsch and overlooking broader issues.
* **Cait Coker:** The prejudice against happy endings may stem from the gendered stratification of art and consumerism.
* **Rebecca Williams:**  The association of happy endings with a lack of originality is odd; many important works have happy endings; genre is key to expectations.
* **Sarah Lyons:** Stories with unhappy endings have more choices in how they unfold.
* **Sonali Dev:** Novelists make statements; socio-political explorations must reveal their results in the ending; character growth should shape the conclusion naturally.
* **Maggie Parke:** Happy endings are not necessarily simple; unsatisfying endings are a popular but sometimes gimmicky trend.
* **Radclyffe:** Tragedies are not inherently more valuable than romances; happy endings are life-affirming and validating.
* **Sarah Lyons:** The devaluation of the romance genre, written largely by women, contributes to prejudice against happy endings.


**Conclusion**

Every ending implies continuation.  The essay concludes by acknowledging the evolving understanding of happy endings, particularly within the context of the #MeToo movement and ongoing social justice debates.  The authors express a desire to further explore these intersections in future work.


**Questions:**

1. What is your working definition of a happy ending?
2. How is the happy ending tangled up with ideas about gender and gender roles?
3. Is the happy ending particularly associated with the United States? If so, why? What are other cultures' understandings?
4. What about fans inserting romance into non-romance genres?
5. Do genres with happy endings have less literary value?

Embracing the Beauty of a Happy Ending: Why We're Attracted to a Joyful Conclusion

By Syed Ahad Ali

In stories, films, songs, and our lives, happy endings offer universal satisfaction.  They're climatic resolutions where tribulations lead to peace, joy, and love. But why do we crave them?

Happy endings aren't limited to fairy tales or romantic comedies; they appear in all storytelling forms.  A happy ending doesn't mean everything's perfect, but it promises a brighter future, fulfillment, and closure.  It reminds us that good can emerge from hardship, inspiring us to approach our lives with purpose.

Why Do We Need Happy Endings?

1.  **Psychological Reassurance:** Happy endings provide comforting closure, reducing anxiety about unresolved problems.  They trigger dopamine release, promoting pleasure and hope, reinforcing the belief in positive outcomes.

2.  **Desire to Win and Learn:**  Witnessing characters overcome challenges instills hope. Happy endings represent success, showing us that we, too, can overcome adversity and achieve our goals.

3.  **Power of Hope:** Happy endings fuel optimism, which fosters resilience, health, and quality of life.  This optimism encourages confidence and perseverance.

Types of Happy Endings and Their Impact

Conclusion: Happy Endings – The "Bittersweet" and Beyond

Not all happy endings are blissfully happy; some are bittersweet, incorporating sadness alongside happiness. These endings reflect real life, acknowledging loss and hardship as part of the human experience. They offer deeper satisfaction by teaching us that happiness doesn't equate to perfection.

Why Happy Endings Matter More Than Ever

In uncertain times, happy endings provide escapism, upliftment, and a reminder that solutions exist.  They influence our emotional well-being, offering optimism. Happy endings also reinforce empathy, kindness, and perseverance.

Role of Happy Endings in Personal Growth

Happy endings inspire us to pursue our goals. Seeing characters succeed motivates us to chase our aspirations and consider what kind of ending we desire for ourselves. They give us the strength to persevere.

Writing Our Own Happy Endings

While we can't control everything, we can influence our lives to create fulfilling endings. We can nurture relationships, pursue passions, and face adversity courageously.  Creating our own "happy ending" involves living purposefully and enjoying the journey.

Conclusion: Durable Happiness

Happy endings, though fictional, profoundly impact readers. They teach resilience, love, and growth, reminding us that hope and a positive outlook are crucial for navigating hardship.  The pursuit of a happy ending, with its ups and downs, is a beautiful part of the human experience.

Audiences Love Happy Endings: The Unspoken Truth About Hollywood and the Happy Ending Illusion

Rasim Avci

Hollywood, where dreams are spun into gold and stories crafted with precision.  But there's an unspoken truth: audiences crave happy endings. This desire for joyful resolutions, where characters find love or victory, is a powerful tool for profit-driven producers.

Nearly all Hollywood decisions are commercially motivated. Sequels minimize risk, and strong returns on investment lead to higher actor salaries. Subject matter and casting remain similar, with endings reflecting commercial savvy.  Profitability and audience interest are paramount.

Happy endings encompass romance, personal growth, and fulfillment, resonating with audiences' fairytale desires.  They align with expectations and producers' understanding of box office success.

Hollywood's Happy Ending Formula Through the Decades

Happy endings have been a staple across decades, shaping films with even the most improbable plots.

* **Classic Era (1950s):**  Films like *Singin' in the Rain* (1952), *Cinderella* (1950), and *An Affair to Remember* (1957) showcased this trend, offering uplifting conclusions and satisfying resolutions.  Even *Roman Holiday* (1953), while bittersweet, provided a positive shift in the characters' lives.

* **1960s:**  This trend continued with films like *The Sound of Music* (1965), *My Fair Lady* (1964), and *Mary Poppins* (1964), delivering triumphant, hopeful, and magical endings.  Other notable examples include:
    * *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961):  Holly Golightly finds love.
    * *The Graduate* (1967):  An ambiguous but intriguing "happy ending" of breaking free from societal expectations.
    * *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1962):  A hopeful note despite the film's complexities.
    * *The Pink Panther* (1963):  A comedic conclusion setting up future sequels.
    * *Charade* (1963):  A light-hearted resolution after a thrilling plot.
    * *How to Steal a Million* (1966):  A successful heist and romance.
    * *Dr. Zhivago* (1965):  A tragic story with a hopeful epilogue.

* **1970s and 1980s:** *Rocky* (1976) and *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982) demonstrate the continued use of crowd-pleasing happy endings, even if unconventional.

* **1990s:** Blockbusters like *Pretty Woman* (1990), *The Lion King* (1994), *Forrest Gump* (1994), and *10 Things I Hate About You* (1999) delivered heartwarming, satisfying resolutions.

* **2000s and beyond:** *The Pursuit of Happyness* (2006) shows perseverance leading to success, while *La La Land* (2016) offers a modern, bittersweet yet fulfilling ending. Even *Barbie* (2023), despite its satirical elements, provides an optimistic conclusion.

Conclusion

Hollywood's manipulation of endings isn't just about feel-good moments; it's about understanding audience desires and maximizing profits. The happy ending formula blends realism and idealism, ensuring a positive, optimistic conclusion regardless of the story's fantastical nature.
