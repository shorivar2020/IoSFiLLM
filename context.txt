OBJECTIVE: The short-term efficacy of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion among general traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is unclear.
METHODS: We used the MIMIC database to compare the efficacy of liberal (10 g/dL) versus conservative (7 g/dL) transfusion strategy in TBI patients. The outcomes were neurological progression (decrease of Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of at least 2 points) and death within 28 days of ICU admission. Each eligible individual was cloned and assigned each of the replicates to one of the treatment arm. The imbalance induced by informative censoring was adjusted by inverse probability weighting. The standardized, weighted pooled logistic regression with 500 bootstrap resampling was used to estimate the cumulative risk difference and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Of the 1141 eligible individuals, 29.0% received RBC transfusion. Compared with the restrictive group, the liberal strategy reduced early death (3 days: 5%, 95% CI: 2%-7%; 7 days: 6%, 95% CI: 3%-11%); however, no significant difference of mortality risk at 28-day or neurological progression risk at any time points was observed. The risk of coagulopathy at 3 days was increased by 7% (95% CI: 1%-19%) in the liberal group. The subgroup analysis indicated a beneficial effect of liberal transfusion on mortality in hemodynamically unstable patients.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with the restrictive strategy, the liberal strategy does not improve the short-term neurological prognosis and death among patients with TBI in a real-world situation. The liberal strategy may be beneficial to survival at very early stage or in hemodynamically unstable subgroup.

OBJECTIVE: While the relationship between smoking and subarachnoid hemorrhage is well established, data regarding the probability of detecting unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) in smokers remain sparse. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between smoking and the likelihood of identifying UIAs in healthy asymptomatic patients who underwent brain imaging for indications unrelated to UIAs.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. The PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for studies published before March 2024 that reported on the presence of UIAs in healthy asymptomatic patients who had undergone brain imaging for indications unrelated to UIAs. Three independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of all retrieved studies. Risk of bias for the included observational studies was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies. Data on UIA prevalence, smoking status, and patient and aneurysm characteristics were extracted. The association between smoking and the presence of UIA was studied. A prevalence proportional meta-analysis was conducted across the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model by using summary statistics from the included studies.
RESULTS: Six studies involving 47,788 patients who had undergone brain imaging were identified for quantitative analysis. The pooled UIA prevalence in the sample was 3.07% (95% CI 2.27%-4.16%). Patients who smoked had higher rates of aneurysm detection than the patients who did not smoke (pooled prevalence of 2.96%, 95% CI 2.68%-3.27% vs 2.23%, 95% CI 2.08%-2.39%). Although the relation between the two was not statistically significant (p = 0.06), smoking was associated with higher odds for UIA detection, yielding an OR of 1.34 (95% CI 1.07-1.67) with an I2 value of 53%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a potentially higher risk of UIAs in patients who smoked than in those who never smoked. However, the results of this meta-analysis revealed that smoking was not statistically associated with higher UIA detection. This result could be explained by the limited number of studies published on this topic. If these findings reach statistical significance in future larger studies, it could justify revising guidelines to include cigarette smokers in intracranial aneurysm screening.

OBJECTIVE: Periventricular anastomosis (PA), a recently recognized cause of hemorrhage in moyamoya disease, is reducible after bypass surgery. The timing of the reduction, however, remains poorly understood. The objectives of the present study were to demonstrate radiological reduction of PA occurring within 48 hours after surgery and to identify factors associated with reduction.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 16 years or older who were diagnosed with moyamoya disease and underwent direct bypass surgery. PAs were assessed using sliding thin-slab maximum intensity projection MR angiography images acquired before surgery and on postoperative day 1. The signal ratio of PA, the ratio of the signal value of the medullary artery to that of the brain parenchyma, was measured at the same point on automatically aligned baseline and postoperative images. The location of bypass was defined as either targeted or nontargeted to the PA.
RESULTS: A total of 68 PAs were analyzed. The signal ratio of PA significantly decreased (mean change [95% CI] -0.16 [-0.21 to -0.11]), while that of cerebellar arteries increased (mean change [95% CI] 0.20 [0.09-0.31]). The interrater reliability measurement of the signal ratio change was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.94). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that targeted bypass (regression coefficient [95% CI] -0.1063 [-0.1558 to -0.0569]) and cross-sectional area of the donor artery (regression coefficient [95% CI] -0.1317 [-0.2101 to -0.0534]) were significant factors contributing to signal reduction of the PA. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that early signal reduction well predicted late-phase reduction (area under the curve 0.78).
CONCLUSIONS: PA could be reduced within 48 hours after direct bypass surgery, suggesting an early preventive effect against hemorrhage. Early reduction, a potential predictor for late-phase reduction, might be promoted by targeted bypass surgery.
